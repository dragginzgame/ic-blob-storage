# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

Initial repository scaffold, dependency setup and extraction planning.

### Added

- Independent Rust 2024 library workspace with Rust 1.98.1, an MIT license,
  repository governance and isolated build output.
- Pinned Candid, Serde, SHA-256, typed-error, IC CDK and stable-storage
  dependencies, with a locked dependency-fetch command and offline native/Wasm
  compilation checks.
- Native-only PocketIC 16 integration-test dependency, verified local server
  provisioning and an overridable server path that prevents automatic downloads
  during tests.
- Maintainer patch, minor, major and exact-version release tooling, including
  release previews, validated version preparation, rollback on failure,
  source-bound release records, atomic branch/tag pushes and separate registry
  publication commands.
- Canic extraction and capability inventories covering storage lifecycle,
  gateway administration, billing, operator commands and diagnostics, with
  replacement acceptance requirements before Canic removal.
- Draft service and acceptance contracts for standalone and Canic-managed
  deployments, including tenant isolation, quotas, paid-effect recovery,
  restore fencing, deletion, billing cessation and installation retirement.
- Caffeine integration baseline for client 1.1.2 and backend reference source
  1.1.1, with package-integrity verification, client hashing observations and
  documented provider-interface and qualification gaps.

### Implementation status

- Storage APIs, provider workflows, clients and canister adapters are not yet
  implemented. The dependency and tooling checks qualify the scaffold only.
- Provider qualification and the B1 service contract remain open. Registry
  publication is disabled, and Canic functionality has not been removed.
