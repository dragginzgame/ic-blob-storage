# Dependency setup

## Current dependency owners

The root [Cargo catalog](../Cargo.toml) owns all direct dependency requirements;
all twelve members inherit package versions and dependencies. The root
[lockfile](../Cargo.lock) owns this checkout's selected graph. Member manifests
select features and targets. Registry consumers resolve their own compatible
lockfiles; local qualification does not cover every future resolution.

| Owner | Locked selection | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blob core | Workspace version | Tenant authority, references, quotas, records, provider accounting, retention, deletion and recovery workflows |
| Blob Contracts | Workspace version | Runtime-free DTOs, method catalog, Blob codec projections, content identities and verification |
| IC Memory | 0.48.1 | Allocation ledger, grants and exclusive runtime leases; the host supplies backing and one allocation pool |
| IC Storage | 0.5.2 | Governed stable collections and codec traits; the stable-structures dependency stays upstream |
| IC Wire | 0.4.0 | Bounded method/direction framing for the two tenant contracts |
| IC Metrics | 0.13.4 | Private probe measurement arithmetic; not a public Blob API |
| IC Testkit / Testkit Candid | 0.53.0 | PocketIC client/server selection, managed lifetime and bounded native Candid fixture decoding |
| IC Host artifacts/fs/process/tools | 0.27.1 | Native artifacts, descriptor-rooted reads, durable publication, processes, framing and interface inspection |
| IC Build | 0.16.0 | CLI source fingerprints and optional archive verification; absent from public libraries and production Wasm |
| PocketIC | 16.1.0 | Testkit-selected local IC execution; no separate Blob server catalog |

The standalone owns endpoint registration, caller capture, lifecycle and memory
composition. The core exports none of these implicitly. Consumer frameworks own
their wrappers and composition tests; see [Canic integration](#canic-integration).
The [service contract](service-contract.md) owns supported service invariants.

Collection constructors take exclusive `RuntimeMemory<Backing>` handles from the
host runtime. Store/workflow generic parameters name `Backing`; passive memory
bundles carry handles without granting access. Production hosts compose all
seventeen Blob requests before a single bootstrap. Cross-release installations
require [safe retirement](retiring-installations.md), not automatic migration.

Native fixture custody uses Memory's published `testing::fixture_runtime` with
retained backing and explicit leases. Raw bytes remain available only to native
corruption/restore fixtures. Memory fixture support is selected by core unit tests
and isolated probes; the default standalone build must exclude those selections.
Do not infer production feature admission from a workspace-wide unified build.

Host owns descriptor-rooted inventory and journal reads, retained creation,
validated publication and bounded subprocess framing. Blob retains input bounds,
request/reply correlation, JSON contracts, uncertainty records and error mapping.
Held descriptors do not freeze contents: callers exclude concurrent writers and
verify complete body digests. Interrupted probe evidence deliberately uses retained
creation rather than an atomic writer that discards partial bytes. These are
necessary consumer policies, not independent filesystem implementations.

The optional archive verifier and HTTP fixtures use the same Host process package
identity. Its normal dependency also supplies the default CLI's bounded framing;
`package-verification` activates Build, not Host process. HTTP fixture support
remains development-only. Build's source inventory is descriptive provenance,
not executable attestation or retry authority. Testkit's transitive dependencies
retain their own identities; Blob must not pass typed values across incompatible
package versions. Installed tool selection is separate from the application lock:
run `make install-testkit` then `make testkit-check` after changing Testkit.

The [service wire guide](service-wire.md) describes the implemented protocol:
tenant inspection/update use published IC Wire; the other 29 owned methods and
standalone lifecycle use bounded CBOR through Ciborium. This mixed surface is
explicit in the canonical method catalog, with no codec fallback. Candid remains
for external provider/management contracts and existing persisted records.
Do not remove Ciborium or Candid as migration leftovers while those consumers exist.
Provider decoders retain their own work/type/byte budgets and authority checks;
Testkit Candid owns fixture decoding, not production provider transport.

The reviewed [Shared snapshot](../.shared-tooling.snapshot) is 0.23.0 at
`0b351cd2ba2bcd8927b783a5fec89afc8013f708` (136 payloads). It owns common Make,
installation, tool storage, formatting, hooks and release mechanics. Blob owns
product inputs, release metadata/publication order, validation selection, Testkit
forwarding and evidence selection. Snapshot files are reviewed distribution,
not independent local implementations; do not edit them in place.
Common versions and digests belong to `ci/tool-versions.env` and `ci/ic-tools.tsv`;
Blob has no common-tool exception. Compiler and application dependencies remain
local selections. The [setup guide](local-setup.md) and
[development governance](governance/development.md) own executable commands.

Earlier source-bound receipts remain in [evidence](evidence/), including
[the Host reader adoption](evidence/host-readers0310.md),
[the initial Wire candidate](evidence/icwire0320.md) and
[Shared/Host qualification](evidence/shared023-host0270321.md).
Their older graphs and preparation blockers are historical evidence, not current
setup requirements. See [current status](status/current.md) for validation limits.

## Quick setup

For ordinary development from the repository root:

1. Install `rustup`; the checked-in `rust-toolchain.toml` selects the maintained
   development compiler and required components.
2. Install the bootstrap packages described in [local setup](local-setup.md),
   including Perl's Digest::SHA, curl, archive utilities and xz. Run
   `make install-tools` to provision the pinned host, IC and Cargo executable
   sets under `.tools/`, then `make tools-check` to verify them offline.
3. Run `make deps` to fetch the exact locked Rust dependencies.
4. Run `make install-hooks` once per clone (also after updating
   developer setup). The reviewed hook uses `make fmt`; CI and release validation
   independently use `make fmt-check`. Both sort all twelve manifests and format
   Rust, without fetching dependencies, compiling or cleaning artifacts.
5. Run `make test-native` for native development checks, or
   `make test-native-host` for CLI/examples, actual PocketIC installation and
   the operator-owned Metrics restoration-read window.

Keep `$HOME/.cargo/bin` and `$HOME/.local/bin` on PATH when using user-local tools.
Release shell checks require ShellCheck; `SHELLCHECK=/absolute/path` may select
an already prepared binary. Install it with `sudo apt-get install shellcheck` on
Debian/Ubuntu or `brew install shellcheck` on macOS. The common local executable
setup covers jq/yq/rg/cloc, IC tools and cargo-sort/cargo-sort-derives/candid-extractor.
ShellCheck and the Rust toolchain remain separate prerequisites.
Missing prerequisites fail rather than being installed
during a hook or validation. Cargo-sort's exact reviewed version is recorded in
[tool versions](../ci/tool-versions.env). That file also owns jq/yq selections;
[the IC matrix](../ci/ic-tools.tsv) owns executable versions and archive digests.
Make prepends `.tools/host/bin`, `.tools/ic/bin` and `.tools/rust/common/bin` to PATH. Missing local tools
fail validation; provisioning is explicit and separate from locked Cargo fetching.
This consumer uses the shared host-tool bundle for jq/yq; the optional upstream
standalone yq installer is not included in its snapshot.
Release preparation uses Shared’s literal manifest renderer without Cargo-edit.
`make release-tools-check` verifies ShellCheck availability and the reviewed
cargo-sort version plus working rustfmt without compiling. The shared
`check-format-tools.sh` performs both formatter probes offline, using the same
consumer pin as setup and CI. Both `fmt` and `fmt-check` depend on this check.
Release preflight runs the same check
before entering full validation. It gives setup commands and supports the
explicit `SHELLCHECK` selection, including executable paths containing spaces.

Browser and standalone rehearsals additionally require PocketIC, Node, browser
packages and Chromium. Follow [setup and checks](#setup-and-checks) for those
paths. Consumers embedding the library should also read
[memory composition](#memory-composition) before assigning stable memory.

## Dependency selector checks

`make dependency-pins-check` checks declarations and tracked workspace lockfiles
without downloading, upgrading or changing them. It runs in the complete gate
and the Linux/macOS tooling workflow. Prepare Git and run `make install-host-tools`
before invoking it. `make host-tools-check` verifies the selected local jq 1.8.2
and Mike Farah yq 4.47.2 without downloading.
The [shared pinning rules](../rules/dependency-pinning.md) define checked inputs
and scoped exceptions. This repository currently needs no pinning exception.

The common installer verifies downloaded bytes before execution and checks exact
versions before activating the complete local tool set. Interrupted or refused
installation preserves the prior active set and its failed preparation evidence.
Validation never installs missing prerequisites.

Registry requirements use compatible ranges. The maintained lockfile continues
to select candid_parser 0.4.1, ic-agent 0.49.2, sha2 0.11.0 and thiserror 2.0.18.
PocketIC 16's own exact thiserror requirement remains part of the locked native
test graph; duplicating it in the library catalog is unnecessary. Shared Tooling
adoption itself does not reselect dependencies. Published library consumers
resolve their own compatible graphs, so the repository's tests do not qualify
every future release.

## Rust versions

The development toolchain and minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) serve
different purposes:

| Scope | Rust version | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development, formatting and lint | 1.99.0 | Pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` |
| Library, standalone, CLI and examples | 1.91.0 | Inherited from `workspace.package.rust-version`; the selected Memory 0.48 line requires 1.91 |
| Unpublished PocketIC harness | 1.91.0 | Inherits the workspace MSRV |

The selected `ic-memory` 0.46 dependency requires Rust 1.91.0, which is now
the workspace's consumer floor. The harness inherits that same minimum.
Earlier Rust 1.88 checks remain evidence for their original source and graphs;
repeat checks with the declared minimum after source or dependency changes
rather than treating dependency metadata as execution evidence.

To repeat the locked native and Wasm compatibility checks after explicitly
provisioning Rust 1.91.0 and its `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

```sh
make msrv-check
```

Keep supported source and dependencies within their declared floor when updating
the development toolchain. These checks cover this lockfile; a consumer's own
dependency resolution must also satisfy its Rust version.

The unpublished PocketIC harness owns `ic-testkit`; production library/Wasm
code has no Testkit dependency. Import its maintained helpers and PocketIC types
through `ic_testkit::pic` and `ic_testkit::pocket_ic`. Use `make msrv-check` for
the repository's public, native and Wasm minimum-compiler checks after explicit
compiler/target and locked-cache preparation.

## Browser certificate evidence

`tests/browser` is a private fixture, with npm-locked `@caffeineai/object-storage`
1.1.2, `@icp-sdk/core` 5.4.0, Playwright 1.63.0 and esbuild 0.28.2. SDK 5.4.0
is within Caffeine's declared `^5.3.0` range; it replaces the earlier fixture's
6.1.0 pin so the composition uses one supported SDK. The Caffeine package is the
latest verified provider package.
The supported runtime range remains Node >=20.19.0. Reproducible fixture setup
selects Node 24.21.0 from `tests/browser/.nvmrc` and npm 12.2.0 from that build
root's `packageManager` declaration. Earlier browser evidence used Node 24.21.0 and
Playwright's Chromium 153.0.8010.12 (revision 1243). Upload fixtures also need
`openssl` on PATH to create temporary loopback TLS keys. Chromium trusts only the
generated certificate's public-key pin; unrelated TLS validation is unchanged.
Setup is explicit:

```sh
make browser-tools-check
(cd tests/browser && npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund)
node tests/browser/node_modules/playwright/cli.js install chromium
make test-browser
```

Select those exact tools on PATH for setup; the build root's `.npmrc` explicitly
selects the public npm registry. `BLOB_BROWSER_NODE=/absolute/path/to/node` and
`BLOB_BROWSER_NPM=/absolute/path/to/npm` select prepared tools for Make checks.
All opt-in browser/SDK Make targets check both tools and manifest/lock declarations
before their effects. Direct bundle builds check Node and manifest/lock inputs;
they use prepared dependencies and do not invoke npm.
The private source client in `clients/browser` is consumed by this build root;
it has no independent install/build or registry publication workflow.
The target bundles existing local
packages, builds the storage and consumer probes and runs the ignored browser case explicitly.
It downloads nothing. Missing packages/browser/runtime fail rather than skip.
The ordinary Rust/CI/release suite does not run this opt-in browser test.
The fixture imports the private reusable source client in `clients/browser`.
Its peer dependency, fixture SDK pin and installed SDK version must agree before
bundling. Git applies the [pinned Caffeine patch](../clients/browser/patches/README.md)
to a generated copy under `.tmp/browser`, after original package hashes are checked.
The installed package is not modified. Application authentication and selection of
the persistent browser environment are caller-owned; the source package supplies
the bounded IndexedDB journal. Its independent `make test-browser-store` target
requires the same provisioned Node/packages/Chromium but no Rust build or PocketIC;
it tests explicit create/reopen and a graceful browser-process restart with an
isolated retained profile under `.tmp/`.
See the [client contract](../clients/browser/README.md).

`make test-browser-launcher BLOB_LAUNCHER_REPORT=NEW_DIRECTORY` checks the maintained
native Chromium bridge with owned loopback assets and an explicitly retained
profile. It covers bounded selected-body reads, FIFO/symlink refusals, fixed-origin
reopening, missing-history refusal, port contention and deadlines without IC or
provider traffic. It uses the same provisioned Node/Playwright/Chromium; the private
client accepts the caller's Chromium engine and adds nothing to Cargo's graph.
`build.mjs` emits maintained `publication-host.js` / `publication-worker.js` plus
the adapted native serial evidence driver. Its Chromium-only `/host.js` import
remains external to the native bundle; executable SDK peer/source/patch checks
still run before every build. See the [process bridge contract](../clients/browser/README.md#launch-chromium-from-a-native-parent).

`make test-browser-publication BLOB_PUBLICATION_REPORT=NEW_DIRECTORY` runs the
frozen-file helper's offline body/manifest/metadata/root/transfer-budget/abort refusals and input
snapshot checks. It requires the pinned packages and Node, without Chromium,
Rust builds or network traffic. The refusing store/transport are explicit test
substitutes; the standalone browser target supplies actual IC/IndexedDB evidence.

`make test-browser-transport BLOB_BROWSER_TRANSPORT_REPORT=NEW_DIRECTORY` runs
owned TLS HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 replay checks without Rust/PocketIC builds. Each
case has a fresh context and one maintained journal claim. Buffered/XHR controls
intentionally replace the outgoing stream to reproduce replay; production uses
only the stream, refuses HTTP/1.x and preserves uncertainty after connection loss.
Request instrumentation observes rather than intercepts upload bodies. Other cuts
can be selected directly with `node tests/browser/transport.mjs NEW_DIRECTORY
refused-stream` or `data-close`. These are local transport observations, not
deployed gateway, billing or universal browser guarantees.

Rust owns the PocketIC installation and test identity. Browser traffic is confined
to that local IC endpoint and the owned page/gateway substitute. The maintained IndexedDB store has two lifetime
slots and no reset/eviction path; it tests transaction ordering, competing tabs,
reload, cancellation and verified historical replies. Caffeine performs real HTTP
tree/chunk requests only against the local substitute. Failed/aborted transfer does
not retry. This is not production sizing, power-loss/eviction durability, rollback recovery, a deployed gateway upload,
or qualification of a consumer's CSP/authentication/storage environment.

### Complete local standalone rehearsal

`make test-browser-standalone` exercises the installed standalone service,
maintained native publisher, browser worker and IndexedDB journal with two local
users and a labelled local provider. It requires the prepared CLI, Testkit server,
Node/packages/Chromium and owned loopback TLS prerequisites. The
[operator guide](operator-guide.md) and [browser client contract](../clients/browser/README.md)
own the command and retained phase/recovery requirements. This is local IC/browser
proof, not application login, deployed provider behavior or billing acceptance.

### Offline native/browser handoff

With the same local packages and Node 24, run the optional preparation check:

```sh
make test-sdk-inputs BLOB_BROWSER_NODE=/absolute/path/to/node \
  BLOB_SDK_INPUTS_REPORT=/tmp/new-browser-inputs-evidence
```

It bundles the hash-checked pinned SDK/patch, builds the native CLI offline and
prepares a 10 MiB file. A passive local configuration fixture feeds
`installation-check`; its exact complete carrier and actual SDK output feed
`upload-inputs`. The generated
`certificate-binding.json` is consumed by the existing browser source client in
Node with an in-memory setup-only store. Snapshot repreparation, no-clobber repeat
and corrupt-source refusal retain exact output/logs in the new directory. All
network calls throw; no certificate issue/recovery or gateway upload occurs.
This check needs neither Chromium nor PocketIC and remains outside ordinary CI.
It establishes no production storage durability, service authorization or provider
guarantee. Existing evidence directories refuse reuse; build artifacts are kept.

## Memory composition

Use `ic_blob_storage::ic_memory` for the library's public storage types. Hosts
compose all namespaces in one Memory 0.48 host-wide allocation pool and open
permanent keys through its committed runtime. A source-identical package with a
different Cargo identity does not share Rust types. Never place a second manager
on the same backing memory.

The host owns the runtime, allocation policy and explicit grants. Include
`ops::service::installation::requests(authority)` before bootstrap: one
configuration key and sixteen service keys. Neither this helper nor linking the
library registers declarations, chooses physical IDs, initializes stores or
exports endpoints. Supply `grants::open(|key| runtime.open_memory(key))` from the
host's retained, already bootstrapped runtime. No default singleton adapter remains.
Standalone owns its bootstrap.
IC Storage's `adapter::StableBTreeMap` owns collection access. Blob's
`ServiceInstallation<M>`, store owners and workflow/transport associated memory
types now use the backing `M`; their memory bundles carry `RuntimeMemory<M>`.
For example, an owner formerly annotated with `RuntimeMemory<DefaultMemoryImpl>`
uses `DefaultMemoryImpl` as its type argument. Supply the same runtime leases;
do not introduce another production manager or use a dependency rename to expose
raw collections. Record bytes, stable keys and production collection layouts
remain unchanged. The private instrumented storage probe alone uses nested
fixture managers, so its read counts include those managers and cannot be
compared directly with older profiles.
Lifecycle restoration is synchronous and leaves the service fenced until the
maintained recovery workflow proves safe activation. Use `LIBRARY_VERSION` for
installation and exact same-release reopening.

### Canic integration

Canic owns its adapter, dedicated shell, embedded wrapper and composition tests
in its repository. Blob owns the framework-independent core and standalone host.
Do not add Canic dependencies, wrappers or fixtures here. The
[Canic composition guide](https://github.com/dragginzgame/canic/blob/main/docs/features/blob-storage/README.md)
owns current framework mounting APIs. Blob's local tests do not qualify Canic.

For consumer adoption of this source:

1. Select compatible Blob core/Contracts packages and the host's same Memory 0.48
   identity. Store/workflow type parameters now name backing memory; constructors
   take exclusive runtime leases. Freeze the application's actual lock and every
   independent fixture lock; sibling paths are not registry-delivery evidence.
2. Include Blob's seventeen requests in the host's single declaration snapshot
   and grant the `blob.` namespace before bootstrap. Validate installation for the
   allocated Principal before opening stores. Mounting initializes nothing.
3. Preserve the host's authenticated initializer and one synchronous lifecycle.
   Translate its admitted configuration to `ServiceInstallationInput`; standalone
   initialization is CBOR, not a template for the framework's outer envelope.
   A Candid outer initializer still requires zero skipping quota and exact argument
   count, including nested application configuration.
   Retain exact target/operation bytes for lost-reply reconciliation.
4. Mount both request and response codecs from the current method catalog:
   tenant methods use Wire, other owned methods use CBOR, and the provider
   certificate uses Candid. Check actual Wasm names/modes and the provider-only
   Candid subset. A Candid service file does not describe the complete Blob API.
5. Run dedicated/embedded PocketIC initialization, target/caller refusal, rollback,
   lost-result, metrics and same-image recovery cases in Canic. Apply the
   [retirement contract](retiring-installations.md) before a cross-release reinstall.
   Same-release recovery never authorizes upgrading a retained installation.

The [2026-10-16 receipt](evidence/canic-issues0310.md) retains its historical
source, stale fixture-lock failures and proposed caller repairs. It does not
establish current integration. The latest read-only source observations and
inspection limits are recorded in the
[architectural sediment audit](reports/audits/2026/10/18/architectural-sediment/01/report.md).
No sibling source or lockfile is changed by Blob adoption.

Managed installation does not complete application acceptance. The application
must authenticate two users, issue exact tenant-approved permissions, operate the
[completion verifier](completion-verifier.md), qualify deployed provider reads and
commit its media map only after exact completion/live references. See
[multi-user authority](multi-user-upload-authority.md),
[confirmed-reference publication](operator-guide.md#produce-a-complete-confirmed-reference-map)
and [funding qualification](funding-consumer-qualification.md). Provider payer,
credit, GC, deletion and billing facts cannot be replaced with local substitutes.

## Setup and checks

`make install-tools` provisions the complete shared host/IC/Cargo set followed by
Blob's lock-selected Testkit CLI/server. `make tools-check` admits those selections
offline. For a changed Cargo-tool policy run `make install-rust-tools`; for a
changed Testkit selection run `make install-testkit`. Setup retains old generations
and failed evidence. Use the same shared-store setting for setup, checks and
failure collection; see [local setup](local-setup.md#shared-executable-storage).

Scoped builds/tests use `--offline --locked`. After dependency changes or cache
removal, run `make deps` explicitly before them; it fetches only the selected
Rust source and does not install executable tools. An explicit offline setting
remains authoritative. Missing dependencies or binaries fail rather than being
installed, replaced or skipped by tests.

PocketIC callers obtain the admitted absolute server path through `make testkit-check`.
Explicit `POCKET_IC_BIN` overrides remain caller-owned byte admission; no fallback,
implicit download or independent server-version equality gate exists here. Testkit
owns client/server compatibility and lifetime. The common five-tool IC bundle is
pinned separately by [ci/ic-tools.tsv](../ci/ic-tools.tsv).

## Release and formatting host checks

The [tooling workflow](../.github/workflows/tooling.yml) qualifies setup/admission,
formatting/hooks, exact-ID tooling archive upload/readback, coordinated package
archives, native CLI/PocketIC and original/optimized Wasms on Linux, Apple Silicon
and Intel macOS. Rust 1.91 has its separate minimum-version lane. Declaring those
jobs is not a passing result; require matching native execution on the actual source.
Cancelled or earlier-source results do not qualify new inputs.

`make evidence-check` and `make probe-check` verify retained records offline;
they make no new provider requests. Failed tooling and package/Wasm evidence stays
at the printed paths and is uploaded by the hosted collectors. Successful fixture
cleanup removes only its own disposable inputs. See
[development governance](governance/development.md) for command authority and the
[release guide](releasing.md) for maintainer validation, delivery and publication.
